## Notes
This project was created before I had a strong understanding of GitHub and its many uses. For a more accurate representation of my current understanding of GitHub, please visit my calculator-application repo.

This project was originally created under a different GitHub account. It has been posted here in an effort to consolidate source code written for all projects in my portfolio.

To avoid licensing issues with middleware assets, only the original source code written by me for this project has been provided in this repository.
